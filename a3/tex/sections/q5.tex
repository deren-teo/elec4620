The Chinese remainder theorem is applicable for any set of divisors that are pairwise coprime, which is true of the set \{5, 6, 7, 11\}. Hence, denoting the number of soldiers $n$, we have:
\begin{align*}
    n \text{ mod } 5 = 3 && n \text{ mod } 6 = 3 && n \text{ mod } 7 = 1 && n \text{ mod } 11 = 0
\end{align*}
We can therefore enumerate the values satisfying each condition until finding a common value between all sets, which we are told must be less than or equal to 1200.
\begin{align*}
    5k + 3  &= \{3, 8, \dots, 1018, 1023\} \\
    6k + 3  &= \{3, 9, \dots, 1017, 1023\} \\
    7k + 1  &= \{1, 8, \dots, 1016, 1023\} \\
    11k + 0 &= \{0, 11, \dots, 1012, 1023\}
\end{align*}
Hence, the number of soldiers after the battle must be $n=1012$.
